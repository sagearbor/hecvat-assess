# HECVAT Scoring Weights
# Weights reflect relative security impact for compliance scoring.
# Used alongside raw question counts to produce a weighted score.
#
# Weight scale: 1-10 (10 = most critical for security posture)
# These weights are applied per-category. Individual question weights
# within a category are equal (the category weight applies to all
# questions in that category).

category_weights:
  # Security-critical categories (weight 8-10)
  AAAI:
    name: "Authentication & Authorization"
    weight: 10
    rationale: "Auth is the primary attack surface. Missing auth = full compromise."
  APPL:
    name: "Application Security"
    weight: 9
    rationale: "Input validation, injection, XSS — direct vulnerability vectors."
  DATA:
    name: "Data Security"
    weight: 9
    rationale: "Encryption, key management, data handling — breach impact."
  VULN:
    name: "Vulnerability Management"
    weight: 8
    rationale: "Known vulnerabilities are the #1 exploited vector."

  # Important categories (weight 5-7)
  CHNG:
    name: "Change Management"
    weight: 6
    rationale: "CI/CD and code review reduce defect introduction."
  AISC:
    name: "AI Security Controls"
    weight: 7
    rationale: "AI-specific attack vectors (prompt injection, model poisoning)."
  AILM:
    name: "AI Language Models"
    weight: 7
    rationale: "LLM-specific risks (data leakage, hallucination, jailbreak)."
  AIML:
    name: "AI/ML Model Security"
    weight: 6
    rationale: "Model integrity and supply chain."
  AIGN:
    name: "AI Governance"
    weight: 5
    rationale: "Policy and oversight — important but less directly exploitable."
  AIQU:
    name: "AI Quality"
    weight: 5
    rationale: "Model quality affects reliability but less direct security impact."
  DPAI:
    name: "Data Privacy - AI"
    weight: 7
    rationale: "AI data privacy has regulatory and ethical implications."

  # Moderate categories (weight 3-5)
  ITAC:
    name: "IT Accessibility"
    weight: 3
    rationale: "Important for compliance and inclusion but not a security vector."
  DOCU:
    name: "Documentation"
    weight: 3
    rationale: "Good practice but doesn't directly prevent attacks."

  # Infrastructure (weight 5-7)
  DCTR:
    name: "Data Center"
    weight: 6
    rationale: "Cloud config directly affects attack surface."
  OPEM:
    name: "Operational Management"
    weight: 5
    rationale: "Monitoring and ops affect detection and response."
  DRPV:
    name: "Disaster Recovery / Privacy"
    weight: 5
    rationale: "Backup and recovery affect incident response capability."

  # Compliance-specific (weight 5-7)
  HIPA:
    name: "HIPAA"
    weight: 7
    rationale: "Regulatory requirement with severe penalties."
  PCID:
    name: "PCI DSS"
    weight: 7
    rationale: "Payment data security — high regulatory impact."
  FIDP:
    name: "FERPA / Data Privacy"
    weight: 6
    rationale: "Education data privacy — regulatory requirement."
  PDAT:
    name: "Privacy Data"
    weight: 6
    rationale: "Data handling practices affect breach scope."
  PPPR:
    name: "Privacy Practices"
    weight: 5
    rationale: "Privacy processes and documentation."

  # Third party (weight 4-5)
  THRD:
    name: "Third Party"
    weight: 5
    rationale: "Supply chain risk is significant but indirect."
  CONS:
    name: "Consulting / Services"
    weight: 4
    rationale: "Service provider risk — less direct."

  # Organizational (not weighted — org attestation only)
  GNRL:
    name: "General"
    weight: 0
    rationale: "Org attestation only — not scored from code."
  COMP:
    name: "Company"
    weight: 0
    rationale: "Org attestation only."
  REQU:
    name: "Required/Routing"
    weight: 0
    rationale: "Routing questions — not scored."
  PCOM:
    name: "Privacy Company"
    weight: 0
    rationale: "Org attestation only."
  PRGN:
    name: "Privacy Regional"
    weight: 0
    rationale: "Org attestation only."
  INTL:
    name: "International"
    weight: 0
    rationale: "Org attestation only."
  HFIH:
    name: "Health/Financial/Insurance"
    weight: 0
    rationale: "Org attestation only."
  PCHG:
    name: "Privacy Change Management"
    weight: 0
    rationale: "Org attestation only."
  PTHP:
    name: "Privacy Third Party"
    weight: 0
    rationale: "Org attestation only."
  PDOC:
    name: "Privacy Documentation"
    weight: 0
    rationale: "Org attestation only."
  PRPO:
    name: "Privacy Policies"
    weight: 0
    rationale: "Org attestation only."

# Scoring formula
scoring:
  raw_score:
    description: "Simple ratio of compliant questions to assessed questions"
    formula: "compliant_count / assessed_count"
  weighted_score:
    description: "Category-weighted compliance score (0-100)"
    formula: |
      For each category with weight > 0:
        category_score = (compliant_in_category / total_in_category) * category_weight
      weighted_score = sum(category_scores) / sum(category_weights_for_assessed_categories) * 100
    note: "Only categories with at least one assessed question are included in the denominator"
